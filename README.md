==========

This is the [task](TASK.md).

Any additional information about your solution goes here.

- the challenge took me way longer than 2 hours (complete day, even a bit more)
- when you are still interested, you can find the implementation in a separate solution branch (maybe easier to see the
  diff, I could even open a pull request if it is desired)
- I added the mapstruct library to reduce mapping code for dto mappings
